Hi Everyone,
My name is Derek.  Im in the process of changing my career and decided since im in construction and build things that learning coding would allow for my imaginative building skills to still be used, but obviously in a different way.  I love to solve problems by disecting processes down to there core features which has allowed me to be a good problem solver in the construction field.  I believe that this transferable skill will allow me to be a great problem solver in computer programming/coding.
